		<h3> How do we classify fishes/fish? </h3>
		<p> First of all, let's make the distinction between the words <i> fish </i> and <i> fishes </i>. <i> Fishes </i> refers to a group of this animal that contains many different species or types. On the other hand, <i> fish </i> is a plural of itself when we are talking aobut just one tyoe or species of the animal. </p>
		<p> When it comes to actually classifying fish, we use many markers, including the body type and size, the color, the location where it's found, and even the people who first found them! You may find more information on fish on <a href="https://www.britannica.com/animal/fish" target="_blank"> Encyclopedia Brittanica </a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish" target=blank" >Wikipedia </a>. </p>
